# March 2021
# This is a new version, backward compatible with the previous one.
# This version can manage connection pools for multiple databases at a time.
# A PgConnection instance represents a connection from a pool of connections for the specified db.
# The pool is created when the first PgConnection for the db is instantiated.
#   The database name may be specified when the PgConnection is instantiated; the default is
#   cuny_curriculum.
#   Cursors use the NamedTuple cursor_factory by default, but a different one can be specified as
#   an argument to the cursor() method.

# January 2020
# Use a connection pool instead of separate connections for each instance. prompted by trying to
# deploy to an affordable Heroku app.
# Also removed commented-out legacy code used during the good-old long-gone Google Application
# Environment days.

# December 2019
# Use the environment variable DATABASE_URL for the connection string. This makes the app deployable
# to heroku, and is best practice anyway.

# This module was first introduced when the app was deployed to the Google Application Environment.
# I've left that functionality, but commented it out, for historical reference. (See January 2020
# note above.)
