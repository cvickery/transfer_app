Reporting:  blanket credit transfers
            review process progress

Need a rule editor for creating/changing rule groups. Output to be Oracle SQL.

Need to show number of blanket credits that transfer when the dest consists of a course + blanket
- Take credits source info into account

In Map Courses: if all rules in a cell transfer as blanket-only the whole cell should be yellow

When looking at the rules for a map cell:
  * the link to event history needs to be implemented.
  * resizeable still not working after much head-scratching

In format_rule()
  * Show RDs for cross-listed courses
  * Indicate rules with future effective date
