# Transfer App

This is a web application for reviewing course transfer rules at the City University of New York (CUNY). The project is a Flask application, and uses a Postgres database backend.

The Postgres database is managed in the [cuny-courses](https://github.com/cvickery/cuny-courses/) project. <hr/>
