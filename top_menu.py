  <summary>Introduction</summary>
  <hr>
  <p>
    In order to obtain a college degree, a student must complete a certain number of course
    credits and must satisfy the requirements specified for an academic program at the college
    that awards the degree. For example, to earn a bachelor’s degree at a CUNY college, students
    must complete 120 credits of coursework, must satisfy a set of University-wide General
    Education course requirements known as “Pathways,” and must complete a set of course
    requirements for a college-specific “major,” such as psychology, mathematics, or English.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a student transfers from one college to another, the coursework they have already
    completed <em>should</em> apply seamlessly to the degree requirements at their destination
    college. Making the transfer process work smoothly across a university with 20 colleges and a
    quarter million students is a major challenge; one that CUNY addresses in many ways. At a high
    level, these may be grouped as <em>university policies</em>, <em>course mappings</em>, and
    <em>articulation agreements</em>.
  </p>
  <dl id="mechanisms-list">

    <dt>University Policies</dt>
    <dd>
      Examples of CUNY policies include uniform credit requirements for degrees (120 for
      bachelor’s; 30 for associate’s); guaranteed transferability of all credits earned at any
      CUNY college; guaranteed transfer across campuses of all Pathways requirements satisfied
      at any campus; and transferability of SUNY General Education requirements to CUNY.
    </dd>

    <dt>Course Mappings</dt>
    <dd>
      CUNYfirst (the name of the Student Information System (SIS) used by all CUNY colleges) has
      over a million<sup>&dagger;</sup> <em>transfer rules</em> that tell how courses at any CUNY
      college map onto courses at any other college.
    </dd>

    <dt>Articulation Agreements</dt>
    <dd>
      An articulation agreement is a document that helps students make the best choices among the
      possible courses they might take to satisfy program requirements at one college before
      transferring to another college. Articulation agreements typically list the course transfer
      rules that will apply when the student transfers, and often contain additional guidance to
      help students plan for an efficient transfer experience.
    </dd>

  </dl>
  <p>
   This website is used to explore the transfer rules in CUNYfirst in manageable chunks. Faculty
   and administrators can use it to see what rules are missing or need to be changed. Students can
   use it to explore what will happen to their course credits when they transfer and/or need to
   take courses at another campus to satisfy a requirement at their home campus.
  </p>
  <h2>A Note on “Blanket Credits”</h2>
  <p>
    Some courses do not have an equivalent course at the receiving college. In those cases, the
    credits will transfer as “blanket credits,” which will count towards the number needed for a
    degree, but are unlikely to satisfy any other requirements, such as part of a major.

        Tabular information about all academic programs registered with the NYS Department of
        Education for any CUNY college. Includes information about program “variants,” such as
        programs that are shared across colleges and/or programs that can award multiple degrees
        or certificates.

      <p>
        This information is obtained directly from a <a
        href="http://www.nysed.gov/heds/irpsl1.html">NYS Department of Education website</a>,
        which is a very nice site, but both awkward to interact with and verbose in its
        output.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tables include links to each program’s requirements, as defined in Degree Works.
        Parsing the requirements from the internal form used by Degree Works into a readable form
        is a work in progress.

      some mobile browsers!

        This feature demonstrates that Degree Works can be used to produce definitive information
        about degree and program requirements across CUNY campuses. At this point it is only
        partly implemented, and is available here as a “proof of concept.”
      </p>
      <p>
        All CUNY colleges use Degree Works to verify whether students have met their graduation
        requirements. A Degree Works “audit” compares a student’s record with the requirements for
        the degree, major, GenEd, and possibly other graduation requirements at a college.
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s demonstrated here is based on an automated mechanism for processing all the
        Degree Works “Scribe Blocks” across the University into searchable information about degree
        and program requirements without that information being coupled to particular students’
        degree audits. For now, the information displayed on the web is generated by analyzing each
        Scribe Block as it is requested, and only certain summary information from each block is
        presented.
      </p>
      <p>
        The intention of the project is capture complete program and degree requirements in a
        searchable database that will allow answers to questions such as how programs articulate
        across campuses, or how Major requirements and GenEd requirements overlap at a particular
        campus, for example.
